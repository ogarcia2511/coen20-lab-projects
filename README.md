The folders in this repository each correspond to a lab assignment for Prof. Dan Lewis' course on Embedded Systems.

Instructions for any of the individual labs can be found at http://www.cse.scu.edu/~dlewis/book3/labs/[folder_name].pdf with the appropriate lab folder name subbed in.

These labs have been tested and successfully run on the ARM Cortex-M4 boards provided by STMicroelectronics.
